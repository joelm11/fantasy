# Fantasy Web App

This is just a CRUD app.
We maintain our list of active players.
We pull up a list of projected players who will earn the most points.
We then make swaps if we can.
We track some basic stats for our players as well.
So we keep a db with our active players.
We keep a db with our players stats each week so we can display some graphs.
